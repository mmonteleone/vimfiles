Learning Vim.  In 2010.  Heaven help me.

Weening myself off TextMate, one day at a time.

As a vim neophyte, I can confidently say you're better off 
finding useful vim bits in a box of Count Chocula than here.

Installation:

*nix (MacVim/GVim)

1. clone to ~/.vim
2. create a ~/.vimrc containing "source $HOME/.vim/vimrc"

Windows (GVim)

Requires ruby, perl in path and Consolas font

1. clone to ~/vimfiles
2. create a a ~/_vimrc containing "source $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc"
